HYPNO - HYbrid Protein NucleOtide phylogenetic gene tree reconstruction
================================================================================

HYPNO is a collection of Python scripts that can improve fine-branching order
(topology) of phylogenetic gene trees via clade reconstruction using nucleotide
information to differentiate between nearly identical protein sequences.

================================================================================


SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
=====================

Python 2.7		(http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/)
Biopython 		(http://biopython.org/wiki/Download)
EMBOSS Needle 	(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_needle/)
FastTree 		(http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install)


USAGE
=====

$ python HYPNO.py MSA-file tree-file [options...]

Options:
	--k <PPWID>		Minimum pairwise percent identity (PPWID) for determining
					subtree grouping (default: 90.0).

	--n <PPPID>		Minimum "predicted protein" percent identity (PPPID) between
					retreived nucleotide sequence and expected sequence for
					retreived sequence to be accepted (default: 95.0).

	--s <PCS>		Minimum percent of correct sequences (PCS) required in an
					acceptable tree. This values depends on --n <PPPID>. Any
					value less than 100.0 may result in an output tree with
					fewer taxa than the input tree. (default: 100.0)


EXTENDED USAGE
==============

The script is invoked from the command line and the user must specify the path 
to the multiple sequence alignment file (MSA-file), encoded in FASTA or 
UCSC a2m format along with the original protein tree (tree-file) in Newick
format. Both files must contain valid Uniprot accession for each sequence/leaf 
that are consistent between files. Additional options may be specified to 
refine subtree definition and nucleotide and tree acceptance criteria.

$ python HYPNO.py MSA-file tree-file [options...]

Options:
	--k <PPWID>		Minimum pairwise percent identity (PPWID) for determining
					subtree grouping (default: 90.0). Adjusting this parameter
					may alter the size of subtrees for which topology is
					reevaluated. Very large values may result in no subtrees and
					no change in tree topology while very small values may
					result in overly large subtrees and incorrect taxa grouping.

	--n <PPPID>		Minimum "predicted protein" percent identity (PPPID) between
					retreived nucleotide sequence and expected sequence for
					retreived sequence to be accepted (default: 95.0). This
					parameter determines acceptance criteria for retreived
					nucleotide sequences. Retreived nucleotide sequences are 
					translated to protein using appropriate codon translation
					tables. If the percent identity between the translated
					retreived sequence and the original protein sequence falls
					below the threshold, the nucleotide sequence is not
					considered representative of the protein sequence and is
					discarded from the alignment and subsequently the tree.

	--s <PCS>		Minimum percent of correct sequences (PCS) required in an
					acceptable tree. This values depends on --n <PPPID>. Any
					value less than 100.0 may result in an output tree with
					fewer taxa than the input tree. (default: 100.0) This
					parameter determines what fraction of sequences can be 
					discarded from the alignment and subsequently the tree as 
					a result of the unavailability of sequences or poor identity 
					between protein sequence and retreived nucleotide sequence. 
					Setting the PPPID and PCS value very high (overly stringent) 
					may result in the production of no output tree.
