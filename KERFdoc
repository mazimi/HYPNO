KERF is an in-house method that is not yet published. It takes as input an MSA and a tree and cuts the tree into subtrees. The subtree cuts are based on a user-specified maximum divergence within each subtree that is estimated on the basis of pairwise percent identity in the MSA). The previously generated MAFFT multiple sequence alignment, the minimum Pairwise Identity calculated in the MAFFT step and the Quick Tree generated tree are all used as inputs to KERF. With these inputs, KERF generates cuts of the tree into the fewest possible number of subtrees so that no pair in any subtree has less than the previously stipulated minimum pairwise identity. The output of KERF is a set of sub-MSAs in FASTA format and subtrees. Sometimes many of the sub-MSAs contain columns that are entirely gapped. The solution to this is to mask the sub-MSAs prior to submitting them to SATCHMO. Columns that have an excessive number of gap characters are masked by turning the amino acids in those columns to lower case letters and the corresponding dashes in those positions to dots. SATCHMO should now interpret these positions as generated in an HMM insert state. This will turn any columns, which are at least 70% gaps into lowercase letters and dots. Only the sub-MSAs are used as input for SATCHMO
